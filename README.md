                                      Heart Disease Prediction
  
Introduction:   
   This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease, enabling proactive medical interventions.

Dataset:
   The dataset used for training and testing the predictive model is sourced from 
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

Methodology:
 
 
 Data Preprocessing-> The raw dataset itself is clear and preprocessed,so no preprocessing needed.

 Model Selection->Several machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests are evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the preprocessed dataset. And to implement decision tree is used in thois project.

 Model Training and Evaluation-> The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the selected machine learning models. The models' performance is evaluated using its accuracy.

Usage:
 Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to your desired environment for real-time predictions.

Results:
The performance of the heart disease prediction model is of Accuracy:100%
